/*
String manipulation
With operators
Operators act on data by assigning them to a variable, comparing them, or including them in arithmetic operations.
var a = "Hello";
var b = "World";
console.log(a + " " + b); //prints "Hello World"

With string methods
String methods are built into javascript and can be used to alter or return information about a string.
var a = "string";
console.log(a.toUpperCase()); // prints "STRING"
console.log(a.length()); // prints 6
